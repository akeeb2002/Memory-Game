## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [x] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific.

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, the first functionality I would try to work towards would be by making the game buttons sound more complex. Instead of the buttons being a single tone, I would have them be the voices of different characters or be a sequence of multiple tones that matches with the images shown after pressing each button. Furthermore, a feature I would implement is allowing the user to press a hint button which would repeat back the previous pattern. The user would be allowed 3 hints in total, but to not make the game too easy, every time they received a hint the player would be allowed to make one less mistake and vice versa. Additionally, I would make it so that the game has two separate screens with each having different backgrounds to distinguish them from each other. The first screen would be the introduction screen where the player is greeted and told the rules of the game. On the bottom of this screen you would have a “Start” button which would lead the player to the next screen. The second screen is where the game would be played. Right when the user enters this screen a timer would start and once it reached 0 the game would begin. Lastly, I would try to fix a few of the bugs I noticed while playing the game. For example, sometimes after pressing a button it would continue playing the tone rather than going back to its original state even though the button wasn’t being pressed anymore. I can’t say I will be successful since I don’t have much experience with debugging, but I would try to look it up online and learn how to do it.
